## 🌊 Flood Predictions

**File:** `Flood_Predictions.csv`  
**Generated by:** `export_predictions.py`

### 📘 Description:
This dataset contains all original flood-related features plus one new column generated by our AI model.

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| MonsoonIntensity | Rainfall and seasonal intensity score |
| TopographyDrainage | Terrain drainage capacity |
| RiverManagement | River flow management index |
| Deforestation | Deforestation impact score |
| Urbanization | Urban area growth level |
| ... | (other columns from flood.csv) |
| **Predicted_FloodProbability** | **Model-predicted flood likelihood (0–1 scale)** |

### 🧠 How to use in Power BI:
- Import `Flood_Predictions.csv` into Power BI.  
- Visualize **Predicted_FloodProbability** vs other features like:
  - Urbanization
  - Deforestation
  - RiverManagement  
- Create maps, bar charts, or trend lines showing **flood risk levels**.

## 🌋 Earthquake Predictions

**File:** `Earthquake_Predictions.csv`  
**Generated by:** `export_predictions.py`

### 📘 Description:
This dataset contains all original earthquake features plus a model-generated prediction column.

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| magnitude | Earthquake magnitude |
| depth | Depth below surface (km) |
| latitude / longitude | Location coordinates |
| continent / country | Geographical region |
| ... | (other columns from earthquake_1995-2023.csv) |
| **Predicted_Tsunami** | **Model-predicted tsunami risk (0 = No, 1 = Yes)** |

### 🧠 How to use in Power BI:
- Import `Earthquake_Predictions.csv` into Power BI.  
- Use **Predicted_Tsunami** to:
  - Map tsunami-prone areas  
  - Filter high-risk regions by magnitude  
  - Combine with date/time for timeline visuals

## 🧩 Notes
- Both CSV files are fully preprocessed and ready for visualization.  
- These files are **AI-powered outputs**, generated using trained models:
  - `flood_model.pkl` (RandomForestRegressor)
  - `Earthquake_model.pkl` (GradientBoostingClassifier)
- No further preprocessing is required on the Power BI side.
